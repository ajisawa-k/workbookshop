# Product Display Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
The web application was showing only a limited number of products (5 hardcoded items) instead of displaying all products from the workbookshop database.

## Root Cause
- The `workbookshop` database was not properly initialized
- The `workbookshop.sql` file was missing from the repository
- MySQL authentication was not configured for the MariaDB Java client
- The application was falling back to hardcoded sample data in `ProductLogic.java`

## Resolution
1. **Database Setup**: Created and populated the `workbookshop` database with proper table schema
2. **Authentication Fix**: Configured MySQL to use `mysql_native_password` for compatibility with MariaDB Java client
3. **Data Population**: Added comprehensive product data (25 products) covering various office supplies
4. **SQL File Creation**: Created `workbookshop.sql` with complete database initialization script

## Results
- ✅ Database connection working properly
- ✅ ProductDAO successfully retrieves all 25 products
- ✅ Application no longer falls back to hardcoded data
- ✅ Search functionality working correctly
- ✅ All product categories represented (furniture, stationery, electronics, etc.)

## Product Categories Added
- Office furniture (cabinets, desks, chairs)
- Stationery (pens, notebooks, erasers, rulers)
- Office supplies (files, clips, staplers)
- Printer supplies (toner cartridges, paper)
- Electronics (USB drives, desk lights)

## Database Schema
- `product` table: Product catalog with ID, name, and price
- `usr` table: User accounts
- `order_main` table: Order headers
- `order_desc` table: Order line items

The application now properly displays all products from the database instead of the limited fallback data.
